# Fishing effort in the Northsea

The goal of these notebooks is to assess the fishing efforts in the North Sea in the last ten years (2012-2022). The data and methods of [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/) are used. 

Jupyter Notebooks are used to explore the different API endpoints of Global Fishing Watch. 

Some important steps are:
1. Aggregate fishing efforts in grid cells in Marine Protected Areas
2. Group by vessel_id, year and gear.
3. Find spatial and temporal patterns
4. Identify problematic ships
5. Find their movement data
